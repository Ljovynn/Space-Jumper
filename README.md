# Space Jumper
 Control a jumping spaceship through randomly generated planets to reach the goal in time!

# How to play

Create an empty Unity 3D project in Unity version 2022.3.8f1
Copy the Assets, Packages, and ProjectSettings folders into the new project file
Now you have the game in the editor. You can also build the game as well.
The controls are explained in the main menu.

# Resources used

I mostly used Unity API, knowledge from lectures / previous experiences, as well as help from a mentor.

I used this guide for camera controls:
